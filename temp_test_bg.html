				maybe rbg mode for side glow and maybe other stuff?? xd
				<br><br>
				todo: calc improvements:
				better css
				make code have standardized interface to allow easy access to other list apis
				pointercrate could have a class with constructor that allows overrides for param 1: url, and param 2: score function
				add support for any other list with api
				add a section to describe how the calculation works
				<br><br>
				add keyword tags (e.g. pointercrate, geometry dash, demonlist, list)
				<br><br>
				maybe have a resultant records thing? idk
				<br><br>
				github link to userscript in main section, and also add footer links
				
				
				
				
				<pre>
				CHANGELOG:
				1. split code into several files so its less pain
				
				
				code notes:
				
				ADD TODOS TO CHANGELOG WHEN DONE
				first todo: is have a single api constant definition, and next have api interface
				todo: i should grab a list of all scores from the listed endpoint and use them to fill remotePts in playerstate, this will function as checker for if score function appears to be wrong (i need to think if check exact value or not, might be fine for exact since js and pc use doubles both iirc), but if i tell user "hey this might be wrong" i should have note that it might be that the player got a new record - wait cant i just check that? since id image im loading rRecs with pts if i do load pts (maybe remote pts i just check my pts against top50? ig)
				
				currently playerstate has real and theoretical records, it also stores value for real and theoretical records, and it doesnt use api value yet, playerstate also has an overrides handler, and a ready bool, it has a func to load player info, and alternatively init an empty player (why cant this be 1 func with early return if id===0?)
				tRecs (theoretical records) are real records with overrides applied to them
				playerstate has funcs to init tRecs, add tRec, and remove tRec (actually replaces it with rRec), update theoretical points, and update points delta
				
				ok i need to uhm see how the interface gets updated
				
				maybe add link in footer to userpage version
				
				maybe also have about section, saying software used, services used, and add link to cloudflare worker page
				
				i should split in 2 columns on widescreen
				i should not have the og records make the border line (if rRecs empty {dont show og records thing})
				
				also i should have record sorting by points/name/rank
				
				todo: firefox autofills inputs on refresh, but my script doesnt know the fill-in is there
				
				maybe show point delta for each override?
				
				maybe if i add about section i can mention dark mode toggle being in top right
				
				
				maybe max main width should be (100%-2*marginIWant) instead of just a set value?
				maybe dark mode toggle shouldnt have rounded corners? idk
				
				i need to update formula lmao (also a chance to test self check and multi formula thing when thats done)
				
				maybe save what user is doing? idk
				maybe have service worker to save last api responses? (or just use localstorage/cookie so its not api-dependent)
				
				
				maybe some clear overrides button? idk (also a "load empty player button")
				future idea: maybe allow loading by id? also maybe being able to handle legacy records in rRecs?
				
				maybe move init promise into the ApiInterface object
				
				todo: make formula selector not need another button press
				make progress select not stick up into demon select
				
				how loading should be:

				first: a function should clear everything that should be (if anything), show a loader, and then run the init process, a loading icon should show (if loading fails, i need to show a popup)
				
				overrides should be under apiInterface, as same override doesnt make sense on other list
				
				when a change happens, it should be given to overrides handler, which handles its html, and then passes it to player which handles its html
				todo: when selecting player it loads top50 again, if selected player isnt top 50 it gives empty box
				add search caching
				
				change embed msg to not say pointercrate after i add the others
				
				priority list:
				1. add button to add 0% override on real record maybe (just hav event listener on container)
				2 add usage analytics stuff
				3. self checker for latest score func (have a popup with hide, hide until refresh, and hide for session buttons) - idk abt this cuz formula changes r rare now
				4. add lists (challenge list, mobile list, aredl) (do the stuff that have api-specific code first maybe so i dont add these then have to change their code)
				5. 2 column thing for wide displays maybe
				6. decouple overrides from player maybe, so u can switch players while keeping overrides
				7. copying/pasting overrides (ig put json in clipboard or smth)
